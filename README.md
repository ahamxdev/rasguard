# RasGuard: A Layer 2 Firewall for Detecting and Mitigating DDoS Attacks on Raspberry Pi

## Introduction
In today's interconnected world, **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attacks pose a significant threat to network stability and service availability. These attacks overwhelm systems with malicious traffic, leading to downtime and service degradation. 

This project focuses on building a **Layer 2 firewall** using a **Raspberry Pi** to detect and mitigate specific types of **TCP-based DDoS attacks** (SYN Flood, ACK Flood, TCP Connection Flood, and FIN Flood). The firewall is designed to analyze traffic between two network interfaces (ports) and block malicious IP addresses for a set period, providing a robust defense against common DDoS attack methods.

## Project Objectives
- ‚úÖ **Implement a Layer 2 firewall** on a Raspberry Pi to analyze and forward packets between two network interfaces  
- ‚úÖ **Detect and mitigate TCP-based DDoS attacks**, specifically SYN Flood, ACK Flood, TCP Connection Flood, and FIN Flood  
- ‚úÖ **Automate IP blocking** for attackers based on predefined attack thresholds (e.g., blocking an IP for 5 minutes after attack detection)  
- ‚úÖ **Leverage Python** to monitor and analyze network traffic in real-time, utilizing libraries such as `scapy` and `NetfilterQueue`  
- ‚úÖ **Create a scalable solution** for real-time DDoS attack mitigation

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Raspberry Pi and OS**  
   - Install Raspberry Pi OS on a microSD card  
   - Update system packages and optimize network settings for firewall operation  

2. **Network Bridge Setup**  
   - Configure a **Layer 2 bridge** between two network interfaces (e.g., eth0 and eth1) on the Raspberry Pi  
   - Enable packet forwarding between interfaces and set up iptables for traffic routing  

3. **DDoS Attack Detection**  
   - Implement packet analysis using **scapy** to detect **SYN Flood**, **ACK Flood**, **TCP Connection Flood**, and **FIN Flood**  
   - Set thresholds for attack detection (e.g., more than 10 SYN packets in 1 second indicates a SYN Flood)  
   - Develop a mechanism to **block the source IP address** for a set time after detecting a flood attack  

4. **Python Script for Real-Time Monitoring**  
   - Use **NetfilterQueue** to receive and inspect packets from iptables queues  
   - Implement attack detection logic to check for patterns indicative of DDoS attacks  
   - Automatically block IPs involved in attacks using **iptables**  

5. **Testing and Optimization**  
   - Test the firewall by simulating various DDoS attack scenarios (e.g., using tools like `hping3` or **LOIC**)  
   - Analyze the performance of the firewall and optimize packet inspection algorithms for better efficiency
