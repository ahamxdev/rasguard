RasGuard
Design and Implementation of a Hardware Firewall Based on Raspberry Pi 3 to Mitigate DDoS Attacks
Introduction

With the rapid advancement of technology and the expansion of internet networks, cyber threats have significantly increased. One of the major challenges in this field is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which can disrupt network operations and degrade service performance.
This project focuses on designing and implementing an efficient hardware firewall based on Raspberry Pi 3, capable of detecting and blocking malicious traffic.
Project Objectives

    Designing a hardware-based firewall that runs on Raspberry Pi 3
    Monitoring and analyzing network traffic to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks
    Optimizing network request processing to improve performance
    Implementing an alert system to notify administrators of potential attacks

Required Hardware and Software
Hardware

    Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
    microSD Card (Minimum 16GB)
    5V/2.5A Power Adapter

Software

    Raspberry Pi OS (Lite)
    nftables & iptables for network traffic filtering and firewall configuration
    tcpdump & netstat for real-time network activity monitoring
